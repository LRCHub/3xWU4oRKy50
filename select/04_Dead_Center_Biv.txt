Come out it's safe
Spending your days awake
Peeling it all away
Leaving us all to hate
Can't see my face
Cut through my veins
Said you been on your way
You release all my space
Sat down in my name
Only want me for blame
They've counted my days
They've counted my, yeah

Fuck the old you
Fuck you talkin right back
I ain't know you
You the last one left
They control you
Finna run it right back
Fuck I told you yuh
Black out the days
Better off out of your way
Just out of your way
Just out of your way

And we love, death the prize
And we're afraid to be alive

Fuck a G Class Benz
I want a home in advance
Spend all the cash out my hands
Bitch I'ma burn it instead
Enemies I had
Killing them off in my head
Better than what you been had
Better than what you been had

And we love, death the prize
And we're afraid to be alive
