Bitch, look at this
I'm pulling up, I don't give a shit
Who the fuck he think he playing with? Nigga
Bitch I said, what I said, when I said it
Nigga i won't regret it bitch
I pull up and get rid of it
If I was you I'd
Think again before assembling
I dismember it
He wonders where his members went
I remember when you didn't wanna see me win
Now you pretend to and lie to
Them as if we been friends
My friend is the Benny J Franklin
I shook him off
Now he wonders where his ankle went
Them hoes janky
I ain't tryna hanky panky bitch
I pull up, I'm wrecking shit
Don't make me crank a bitch
I put on the underglow
And then I hit the switch see me riding
Out here flying off the blood rip
Stay up out the fucking way
That's my best tip
I put a foreign 2-2 and took another sip
She pulled a knife
Then she put it to his upper lip
I hit the clutch and switch a gear
And then I hit the strip
Bitch I said, what I said, when I said it
Nigga i won't regret it bitch
I'm nothing to be tethered with
I give no fuck bout none of you
Niggas or who you schedule with
Play with me and I'mma show
You why you should've quit
